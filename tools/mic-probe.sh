# Find out whether this remote has a working microphone.
#
# Everything here runs on the device and writes only to /tmp there; the one
# thing that comes back is a WAV you can listen to. couch-mic contains no
# network code at all, so nothing it records can leave except by this script
# copying it.
#
# Run it, and make a noise - talk at the remote, tap its case - for the whole
# sweep. The whole point is to find which of the card's capture devices hears
# you, and silence proves nothing.
#
# The device must already be on WiFi with sshd running; see docs/webui.md for
# how a key gets enrolled. sshd lives inside the Alpine chroot, so /opt/couch
# in a session is /mnt/alpine/opt/couch as the initramfs sees it.
