# Build every ARM binary the runtime payload inventory lists, on the release
# host, in one command. Each step is the same script or cargo invocation a
# developer runs by hand; this file only fixes the order and makes sure the
# two pieces of environment that cargo cannot supply - the ARM musl C compiler
# for ring, and the Sonos developer key - are set once for all of them.
#
# Afterwards, run tools/release/runtime_inventory.py on this same checkout
# (docs/runtime-payload.md) so the hashes describe the binaries just built.
