//! The hardware keypad.
//!
//! Two evdev nodes matter on this device: mt_gpio_kpd and mtk-kpd. Both are
//! read, because which one a given key arrives on is not obvious and a press on
//! the wrong one simply vanishes.
//!
//! Everything read in one batch is decoded, in order, into a queue; `poll`
//! hands back the front of it, one per frame. The queue is what makes two keys
//! pressed inside one frame both count, and it is what keeps a release from
//! being thrown away when a microphone edge arrives beside it - a lost release
//! leaves the key held, and a held key repeats every 70ms until it is pressed
//! and released again.
//!
//! Autorepeat is disabled in the device tree, so holding a key repeats only
//! because this implements it. The debounce is set in the odmdtbo overlay
//! (lowered from 50ms to 8ms) - without that, a rapid double tap arrives as a
//! single press and the UI looks broken.
