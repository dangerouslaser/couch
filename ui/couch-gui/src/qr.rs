/// | SSID | version | modules + quiet | px/module | image |
/// |---|---|---|---|---|
/// | 1-8 chars | 2 | 33 | 8 | 264px |
/// | 9-24 chars | 3 | 37 | 7 | **259px** |
/// | 25-32 chars | 4 | 41 | 7 | 287px |
///
/// The default `Couch-Setup` is 11 characters, so 259px, and no SSID can be
/// longer than 32 bytes. Nothing here reaches 288, and nothing can be made to:
/// the next whole step for a 37 would be 296. Asking for 288 and drawing 259
/// into a 288 box was the bug this note exists for - the caller must size the
/// `Image` from the image, or the fractional rescale that whole-number scaling
/// exists to avoid simply happens one layer further down. The setup screen
/// centres it in a card sized for the largest of the three.
