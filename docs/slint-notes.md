# Slint on this device

Notes that cost time to discover. Slint 1.17.1, software renderer, no `std`.

## The feature set, and why

```toml
slint = { version = "1.17", default-features = false, features = [
    "compat-1-2", "renderer-software", "libm", "unsafe-single-threaded",
] }
```

No `std`, deliberately: that feature turns on system font discovery, which pulls
`yeslogic-fontconfig-sys` - a C library wanting pkg-config and a cross sysroot,
for a device with no font system. This is the configuration Slint's
microcontroller targets use.

## Vector paths: available, but opt-in on two crates

`Path` works in the software renderer. Getting there is not obvious, and two
wrong conclusions came out of it before the right one:

- It is **not** gated on `std`. What is std-gated is the *re-export* of
  `PathData` from `i-slint-core`, which is not what generated code needs.
- The software renderer **does** implement `draw_path`, behind its own `path`
  feature (pulling `zeno` and `lyon_path`).

The feature must be enabled on **both** crates, and the `slint` facade forwards
it from neither, so they have to be named directly:

```toml
i-slint-core = { version = "1.17", default-features = false, features = ["path"] }
i-slint-renderer-software = { version = "1.17", default-features = false,
                              features = ["path", "libm"] }
```

Enabling it on `i-slint-core` alone gives `error: not all trait items
implemented, missing: draw_path` - the trait grows the method while the
renderer's implementation stays compiled out. That error reads as "paths are
unsupported"; it means "half configured".

Note `lyon_path` appears in `cargo tree` regardless: `i-slint-compiler` uses it
at build time. That is host-side and does not reach the target binary.

We are **not** using this today. Measured against rasterised alpha masks it cost
186KB and about 10% more per frame, and the design is authored so every glyph is
a rectangle, a circle or a triangle - so the capability had nothing else to pay
for itself with. If a circular scrubber or an arc meter ever lands, turn it on
and `lucide-slint` becomes nearly free on top.

## Glyph embedding happens at compile time

Glyphs are embedded from strings that appear in `.slint`. A character that only
ever exists in a runtime string is never embedded and renders as a blank gap -
which is what happened to every `·` separator when the subtitles were composed
in Rust. Compose such strings in `.slint` with the separator as a literal.

The compiler seeds that set before it looks at any literal, with `a-z`, `A-Z`,
`0-9`, `●`, `…`, space, and the punctuation `!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_{|}~`
(see `passes/embed_glyphs.rs`). So the rule bites for anything outside that: an
accented letter, a currency symbol, an arrow - and, of printable ASCII, the
backtick, which is the one character the seed leaves out.

The cost of a size is the whole set at that size, in every embedded face, and
it goes as the square of the size. Measured against this UI: 32KB at 20px, 40KB
at 26px, 162KB at 48px, 327KB at 72px. Reusing a size the UI already asks for
is free; picking one two pixels away is not.

`SLINT_FONT_PATH` and `SLINT_DEFAULT_FONT`, set in `build.rs`, choose the face.
Ship every weight the UI asks for: `font-weight: 600` against a single Regular
face gets synthesised rather than resolved.

## `.slint` can grow a string but not shrink one

The string members are `is-empty`, `character-count`, `is-float`, `to-float`,
`to-lowercase`, `to-uppercase`. There is no substring, no slice, no index. `s +
"a"` is available; taking that `a` off again is not, which means a backspace
cannot be written in `.slint` at all.

`TextInput` is the way out, and it is worth reaching for rather than working
around: it owns a real buffer, a cursor, `input-type: password`, and
scroll-to-cursor. It can be driven without ever being typed into - its
`key-pressed` callback runs *before* its own handling, so a D-pad's arrows can
be claimed before it sees them, and a delete is `set-selection-offsets(n-1,
big)` then `cut()`. `cut` copies to the clipboard first, but
`Platform::set_clipboard_text` defaults to a no-op and this device implements
none, so nothing escapes. Offsets are bytes, and are clamped rather than
checked: an offset past the end lands at the end.

Set `text-cursor-width`, `color`, `selection-background-color` and
`selection-foreground-color` explicitly. Anything left unset is filled in from
StyleMetrics and the palette by a compiler pass, which pulls the widget style
into a binary that has no widgets in it.

## A component's root cannot see `parent`

A component's own root has no parent at definition time, so `parent.width` there
is an error. Either measure off `root` (its own geometry, set by the caller) or
take the value as a property. The focus ring takes the box it rings; the volume
overlay is positioned by its caller.

## DirtyRegion holds three rectangles

```rust
/// The maximum number of rectangles that can be stored in a DirtyRegion
pub const MAX_COUNT: usize = 3;
```

Past three, `add_box` merges new boxes into whichever rectangle grows least,
"simplified by being bigger than the actual union". A state change touching six
elements collapsed into three bands covering 80% of the panel, and the renderer
faithfully redrew all of it - a partial update that cost more than a full
redraw.

The rule that follows: **make a state change move one element rather than
restyle many**, and never express as geometry what can be expressed as colour
(changing `border-width` changes geometry; changing `border-color` to
transparent does not). Replacing a per-row selected state with one moving
highlight took the dirty region from 80% to 7-14% and the frame from 8.3ms to
2.2ms.

## An `animate` on a binding reads its duration a frame late

A property with an `animate` block comes in two kinds, and the compiler
generates different code for them (`i-slint-compiler/generator/rust.rs`):

- a **binding** (`y: fs.ring-y;`) becomes `set_animated_property_binding`,
  with the `duration:` expression wrapped in a closure;
- an **imperative set** (`self.scroll = x;`) becomes `set_animated_value`,
  with the `duration:` expression compiled inline - evaluated at the set.

For the binding, a changed dependency only flips its state to `ShouldStart`
(`AnimatedBindingCallable::mark_dirty` in `i-slint-core`
`properties/properties_animations.rs`). The closure is not called until the
property is next *evaluated* - the next frame, in the `ShouldStart` arm of
`evaluate`, which calls `compute_animation_details` and reads the value
afresh. So a flag turned off and back on around a change, in one callback, is
never seen off: the duration read is the one after the flag came back.

What it cost: `begin-swap`/`end-swap` bracketing a page swap were believed to
make the ring land and did nothing, and a 90ms opacity fade was quietly hiding
a 160ms tour of the ring from the old page's row to the new one's - visible
whenever the two rows differed.

The rule: **anything whose animation must be on for some changes and off for
others is set imperatively, never bound.** `scroll` always worked that way;
the ring now does too, and the two are set in the same call so they share a
curve.

## A layout overwrites a child's cross-axis position, silently

A child of a `VerticalLayout` (or `HorizontalLayout`) with no cross-axis
`alignment` has its `x` (respectively `y`) binding replaced by the layout's
padding: `i-slint-compiler/passes/lower_layout.rs`, the `stretch_bindings`
else-branch, `bindings.insert(pad...)`, with no diagnostic. `SectionLabel { x:
6px; }` under a `VerticalLayout` with `padding-left: 14px` lands at 14px and
nothing says so. Measured on the device: the label's ink at x=14 where the
cards start at x=20, and the binding that asked for 20 sat there looking
correct.

The rule: inside a layout, inset on the cross axis with padding, or wrap the
element in a plain `Rectangle` and position it inside that, where `x` is
honoured.

## What things actually cost here

Measured on the panel, 480x800:

| | cost |
|---|---|
| memcpy RAM -> framebuffer | 1.3 ms |
| alpha blend, full screen | 11 ms |
| hub focus move (71% dirty) | ~22 ms |
| hub page slide, average | ~10 ms |
| hub page slide, worst | 22-25 ms |

Anti-aliased rounded rectangles dominate. This content runs at roughly 80ns per
pixel against 14ns for flat cards, because a row card, a 26px icon disc and a
focus ring are all rounded and all anti-aliased. Any estimate taken from a
simpler screen will be optimistic by several times - measure the real thing.

`COUCH_REGION=1` prints what the renderer marked dirty each frame. A frame that
costs far more than its content suggests is almost always claiming a larger
region than it needs, and that is invisible without it.

## Dirty regions: what costs a frame, measured on the HA100

`COUCH_REGION=1` prints every rectangle the renderer marked dirty, with
geometry. Read it before optimising anything: three separate theories about a
stutter here were wrong, and the rectangles settled it in one run each.

The case: the focus ring appeared to skip. It did not - the animation frames
were a tidy 12% of the screen at ~2.2ms, stepping 1-2px. Every focus move also
emitted **one 452x654 frame, ~23ms** immediately before the animation started.
The move hitched, then glided.

Things that turned out **not** to be the cause, each disproved by measurement:
the animation itself (removing it left the frame exactly where it was); the
ring's clamping; an `animate` block whose duration read a property; a layout
feedback loop in the row window; the dot indicators; focus arriving as a bound
`in property` versus an imperative function call; focus owned by the component
root versus a zero-size child; and the ring living inside a clipped, scrolling
subtree.

What it was: **three focus rings, one per section.** Each had a `focused`
expression over `focus-row`, so all three re-evaluated on every move - including
moves between rooms, where two of them answer false before and after. Two of
those rings sat at the very top and the very bottom of the pane, and
`DirtyRegion::MAX_COUNT` is 3: past three rectangles Slint merges, and the merge
of "something at the top, something at the bottom" is the whole pane.

Two lessons worth keeping:

**Slint propagates on dependency, not on value.** Hoisting the expressions into
named `bool` properties changed nothing. If an element must not repaint, it must
not *depend* on the changing property at all - naming the expression is not
enough.

**Count your dirty rectangles.** Past three they merge into a bounding box, so
two cheap changes far apart on screen cost more than one expensive change. The
fix was one ring for the whole pane, positioned over whichever cell or row has
focus: one reader, one band.

Bisect by disabling readers, not by reasoning about them. Setting each
`focused:` to a constant `false` in turn took twelve moves from thirteen
oversized frames to one and named the culprit in a single run, after several
hours of plausible theories had not.

Section offsets for that single ring are arithmetic over the same furniture
heights the row window uses, not read back off laid-out elements - reading the
layout back is its own trap, see the note on the row window above.
## Pacing: FBIOPAN_DISPLAY is the vsync wait on this panel

`FBIO_WAITFORVSYNC` returns EINVAL on mtkfb. `FBIOPAN_DISPLAY` with the
startup screeninfo and zero offsets blocks about 17ms - it changes nothing
about what is shown, page 0 is already displayed - so `panel.rs` issues one
after each frame's copy and the loop is held to the refresh. `COUCH_VSYNC=0`
forces a timed 16.67ms sleep instead; `pan` and `wait` force one candidate.

Measured under COUCH_NAV, seven ring moves per five seconds:

| | frames / 5s | work per frame |
|---|---|---|
| unpaced (before) | ~600 | 2.0 ms |
| paced, `interactive` governor | 70-77 | 6.3 ms |
| paced, `performance` governor | 69 | 3.3 ms |

The work per frame went up because the clock went down, not because the
frame changed: the governor is `interactive` with a 604.5MHz floor, and once
the loop sleeps between frames the clock sits there and bounces to 1.3GHz on
load. A ring frame fits the 16.7ms budget at either clock. A page-slide frame
does not - 10-25ms at full clock becomes up to 29ms - which is the argument
for making the slide a copy of two rendered pages rather than a
re-rasterisation of both every frame.

## A page slide is a copy of two frames, not a render of two pages

A page transition here does not animate anything in Slint. The host (see
`transition` in `main.rs` and `Panel::slide` in `panel.rs`):

1. keeps the frame on the panel - the RAM buffer, which equals the panel
   between draws - as page A;
2. applies the change to the UI in one go, as an instant state change: new
   models and `page-swapped()` for an area, `chooser-shown` flipped for the
   chooser, with `ring-hidden` true;
3. renders that once into RAM, with no copy to the panel and no pacing -
   page B. The renderer's partial redraw is fine with this: RAM still holds
   the last frame it drew, and the dirty region is what the change touched;
4. for ~180ms, composes the framebuffer directly from A and B, shifted along
   the same `ease-out` curve everything else uses, one or two `memcpy`s per
   row, pacing each frame with the same FBIOPAN_DISPLAY wait a drawn frame
   gets. Rows that must not move - the status bar, and the pager on an area
   change - are taken from B throughout;
5. clears `ring-hidden`, so the next normal frame starts the ring's 200ms
   fade in. RAM already equals B, and so does the panel.

Why: the rasterised slide - two `AreaPane`s on a strip whose `x` animated -
redrew both pages every frame, 88% of the panel, 10-25ms at full clock and up
to 29ms at the `interactive` governor's floor, against a 16.7ms budget. A copy
of the whole panel is ~1.3ms at any clock. It also removed a prep timer (so
the incoming page was instantiated before the first moving frame), a settle
timer, `*-next` models and a `sliding` flag, none of which the copy needs.

Two things the mechanism depends on:

- **The callbacks only record what they want.** `draw_if_needed` cannot be
  re-entered from inside a Slint callback, and the transition draws, so
  `area-step`, the chooser openers and every way the chooser closes - Escape,
  Left, Right, `chosen` - set an intent that the loop performs after
  `dispatch_event`. The closes that used to write `chooser-shown` from inside
  the FocusScope became a `close-chooser()` callback for this reason. Keys
  pressed during the slide queue in the keypad and are taken one per frame
  afterwards; a second Left simply slides again.
- **Change handlers run from `update_timers_and_animations`**, after the
  animations and timers (`platform.rs`). The chooser's `changed shown` is
  what puts its list back to the top, so that call goes between the state
  change and the B render, or B shows the list where it was last left.
- **The animation clock only advances in that same call.** An animation's
  start time is `current_tick()` at the moment its property is marked dirty
  (`AnimatedBindingCallable::mark_dirty` -> `reset()`), and the tick is the
  one `update_animations` last set. The slide blocks for 180ms without
  calling it, so clearing `ring-hidden` straight after would start the fade
  180ms in - the ring pops. The call is made once more before the flag is
  cleared. Anything that blocks the loop and then starts an animation needs
  the same.

The ring's hide is a bound `opacity` with `duration: ring-hidden ? 0ms :
200ms`. That works despite the animate-on-binding note above because B is
always rendered - the binding evaluated - with the flag true before it comes
back false, so each duration is read under the flag it is for. The old page's
ring simply leaves with it on the snapshot; nothing fades out.

Measured on the device, COUCH_SLIDE with COUCH_REGION, `interactive`
governor at its 604MHz floor:

| | cost |
|---|---|
| page B render, area change | 14-19 ms, once per slide |
| page B render, chooser | 22 ms, once |
| transition frame (compose + copy) | 1.4-3.7 ms |
| frames per slide | 11 at 180 ms, each paced 14-17 ms |
| stat line under COUCH_SLIDE, before | 132 frames / 5s, 8.2 ms avg, 28.9 ms worst |
| stat line under COUCH_SLIDE, after | 79 frames / 5s, 4.6-5.6 ms avg, 19-26 ms worst |

The worst frame is now the one B render; every moving frame is under a
quarter of the budget. A burst of 120 framebuffer captures across the slides
saw 20 distinct states of a card row and 3 of the pager band - the band
changed only when the pager's state did.
