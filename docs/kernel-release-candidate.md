# Kernel candidate and remaining hardware checks

`kernel/release-pin.json` pins source commit `ea122a39` and the exact normal-profile
zImage, effective configuration, compiler and container hashes used in the
September 10 board-initialization test. It contains no device identity or private
firmware. This promotes the tested kernel into release staging; it does not make
an installer image production-ready.

The default Ollie `~/couch-kernel/base` checkout was fast-forwarded to that commit.
Normal builds reject source histories missing this baseline. Later descendants
may be developed, but release verification still requires the exact pinned
candidate and hashes until separately reviewed and validated.

Verify an existing local candidate before staging:

```sh
python3 tools/release/kernel_provenance.py \
  --boot build/couch-board-init-fixed.img \
  --kernel-manifest build/board-init-manifest.json
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/release -p 'test_kernel_provenance.py'
```

The verifier checks the clean normal build manifest and extracts the zImage from
the actual Android boot payload. Runtime inventory also refuses a normal boot
candidate whose kernel differs from the pin. Recovery retains its independent
stock-kernel validation path. Both reports remain `installable: false`; neither
changes USB write gates, release signatures, private/vendor input requirements,
or boot/recovery tests. A matching kernel does not attest a new ramdisk or DTB.

## Validation scope

Confirmed: LG B4 volume up with one repeat while awake and USB docked; button
backlight changes affect GPIO58 without changing touch-reset GPIO4 or board
GPIO17/14/61; advancing GUI heartbeat, recovery BCB clearance and USB serial.

Still required: repeated commands through the normal remote UI, unplugged
standby/wake followed by IR, charging transitions, and clean installer payload
boot/recovery validation. Preserve the working boot image and separate recovery
before any further kernel experiments.

Output telemetry remains compiled into this exact tested binary but defaults
off. Leave `couch_irtx.output_telemetry` disabled for normal use. Removing compiled
diagnostics changes the binary and requires another validation round; retain
that as a later optimization, not an untested replacement for this candidate.

## Remaining bring-up assumptions

1. **Charging semantics need a focused audit.** Stock `red` is a GPIO61 charging
   control callback, not a literal GPIO2 LED. The stock launcher writes it on
   charge-level changes; Couch currently has no equivalent userspace writer.
   Verify charging/full-charge behavior against the kernel charging controller
   before adding a replacement policy; do not infer polarity from the label.
2. **Board header provenance remains partial.** The original bring-up seeded
   some HA100 headers from the donor board. Audit active users against effective
   DT and stock code before enabling additional peripherals; unused donor
   definitions are not verified hardware mappings.
3. **Panel identification retains a GPIO4 maker-ID fallback.** Its current path
   reads the pin; it does not drive touch reset. The selected panel works, so
   this is a lower-priority cold-probe/variant audit, not evidence for changing
   the live reset sequence.
4. **Keep numeric DT callback selectors separate from pins.** HA100 LED dispatch
   now validates both name and selector, and has no raw-GPIO fallback. The LCM
   and display-PWM callbacks are assigned internally, unlike untrusted numeric
   LED data. Do not generalize the original fallback to other integrations.
