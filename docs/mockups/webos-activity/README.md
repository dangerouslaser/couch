# LG TV activity studies

Three interactive 480×800 screen directions, with icon-only playback controls
and no touch equivalents for hardware power, home, mute, D-pad or color buttons.
The sole navigation button returns to Couch without controlling the TV.

Serve the parent directory so the licensed Kodi-study artwork/font are available:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8094 --directory docs/mockups
# http://localhost:8094/webos-activity/
node docs/mockups/webos-activity/check.cjs
```

- **A — Cinema (recommended):** artwork and playback first, with input, picture
  and sound selectors always available. Switch to TV-only mode to see the
  source-focused fallback when media metadata is unavailable.
- **B — Source deck:** prominent source identity and an input rail, above a
  compact playback deck. Useful for frequent switching between HDMI devices.
- **C — Dashboard:** media, favorite apps and a denser settings grid.

All actions are simulated. The default linked-Kodi example uses Tears of Steel
artwork and illustrative metadata; it is not content discovered from the LG TV.
The picture-preset preview is explicitly unverified. The normal picture sheet
explains the limitation and proposes a TV-settings shortcut, whose target still
needs verification. The selected named TV owns its inputs, settings and apps;
a linked player would own its movie metadata and timeline. Multiple TVs must
never share an inferred current source or credentials.

## What the actual LG connection exposed

Read-only probes on 2026-09-09 identified an **OLED48B4PUA**. The TV was using
HDMI 1 during the probe. Existing pairing was reused; no settings were changed.

| Capability | Result / design implication |
| --- | --- |
| Active app / input | Verified: HDMI 1, Mac. Suitable for a source title and status. |
| Input list | Verified: Mac, CoreELEC, Sonos Sound Bar, HDMI 4; connected flags available. |
| Apps | Previously verified list and titles; useful for favorite app launch tiles. |
| Sound output | Verified `external_arc`; selection endpoint exists, alternatives need checking. |
| Power, mute, volume, navigation | Already implemented and device-tested; keep on hardware buttons. |
| Play/pause, rewind/fast-forward | SSAP commands exist; behavior is app/input-dependent. |
| Previous/next item | Not a universal SSAP playlist API. Use only where the player supports it. |
| Picture settings | `settings/getSystemSettings` rejected by this pairing. Do not invent a current mode. |
| Detailed media state | `com.webos.media/getForegroundAppInfo` rejected by this pairing. |
| Channel info | Rejected in the tested HDMI state; not evidence that live-TV channel info never works. |

**Currently playing information:** current app/input is available. Movie title,
fanart, clearlogo, duration and seek position are not established through this
TV connection. Some webOS versions/apps expose playback state, which still
isn't equivalent to full movie metadata. For CoreELEC/Kodi on HDMI, use Couch's
Kodi connection directly and explicitly associate it with the TV input. The
TV UI can then combine real player artwork/timeline with TV picture/input/sound
controls. Native streaming apps need their own verified metadata source or the
honest app/source fallback.

**Picture modes are worth pursuing:** maintained third-party code implements
public `settings/setSystemSettings` picture-mode writes for webOS 9/2024 and
newer. This B4 is a candidate, but firmware, permissions and input/HDR mode
matter. First verify reads with appropriate pairing permissions; then test a
reversible mode change with a known original value. Do not ship blind mode
cycling, hidden calibration calls, or fixed HDR/SDR mode lists.

Do not commit its raw output: system info can include a TV serial number.
Browser checks exercise all three designs, playback, input sheets, picture
fallback, offline mode and mobile overflow. PNGs are exported from the browser.
