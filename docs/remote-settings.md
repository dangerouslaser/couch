# Remote settings

Open **Remote settings** in the configuration web UI (`/settings`). Clock/dock
preferences and accent color live here; appearance was moved out of Areas.

- **Timezone:** choose an installed IANA region, or follow the system timezone.
  Regional rules apply daylight saving changes automatically; `tzdata` is included
  by `tools/provision-alpine.sh`.
- **Time format:** 12-hour with AM/PM, or 24-hour. Applies to the status bar and dock.
- **Show a digital clock while charging:** after the normal dim timeout, keep a dim
  clock on the display instead of switching the panel off. Enabled by default.
  A small position change each minute avoids keeping glyphs fixed in one place.

Tap or press a key to dismiss the clock. The wake action is consumed so it does
not activate the underlying room/device; holding a wake key does not send repeats.
The microphone key retains its hold-to-talk behavior. Undocking dismisses the clock
and starts the usual idle timers. Pairing, setup and recording take precedence.

The kernel battery status (`Charging` or `Full`) enables the dock behavior. It
also applies while charging over USB; this hardware interface does not identify
the physical dock separately. Charger presence without active charging is not
sufficient. Normal dim/off timeouts remain adjustable on the remote itself.

Settings are stored in `config.json` under `remote`, with backward-compatible
defaults. `PUT /api/remote` validates timezone against `GET /api/remote/timezones`.
The GUI reads updates without restarting. A worker formats the clock using local
tzdata once a minute or when settings change; timezone subprocesses never block
rendering. No system-wide timezone file or clock is changed.

Validation includes browser save/reload, timezone path traversal rejection and
an on-device mount-namespace fixture for charging, time format changes and wake.
Physical dock detection should be checked against the real charging indicator.
