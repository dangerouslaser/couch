# Inputs for installing on an original Android HA100

This audit is offline. It does not enable the public installer, alter USB
transport policy, or demonstrate installation on a previously unmodified unit.

## Preserve identity without an existing Couch baseline

Sanytron asks owners to save Device ID, Wi-Fi MAC and Bluetooth MAC before
flashing, using the Android settings screens. Its guide documents user-visible
values, not partition offsets or a binary decoder. See the
[official identity-backup instructions](https://hub.sanytron.com/support/astrion/backup-device-identity).

The current private installer compares an earlier Couch runtime baseline. A
fresh Android unit needs a separate first-capture workflow: identify the model,
read both GPT copies, retain the fixed-format DA storage identity, and save all
five protected partitions (`proinfo`, `nvram`, `nvdata`, `protect1`, `protect2`)
with independent readback before any persistent write. That establishes a new
opaque preservation baseline; it must not claim that Device ID/MAC fields have
been decoded or matched. Never manufacture an expected runtime baseline by
copying the device's current values into a record labeled previously verified.

Confirmed stock evidence:

- Launcher 1.4.2 `SettingAboutActivity` displays `Build.getSerial()`; its
  `formatSerial` method only inserts spaces. `MachineUtils` also reads
  `ro.serialno`, but has development fallback logic and is not the primary
  About-screen source.
- Stock `init.mt6580.usb.rc` writes `${ro.serialno}` into Android USB `iSerial`
  and `${ro.product.model}` into `iProduct` on boot. Reading the normal Android
  USB serial before reboot may provide an ADB-free Device ID capture. This
  needs physical validation and matching to the subsequent selected USB port;
  the preloader descriptor is not assumed to carry the same serial.
- Stock `libcustom_nvram.so` names `/vendor/nvdata/APCFG/APRDEB/WIFI`,
  `BT_Addr`, and `PRODUCT_INFO`. Init creates/mounts the nvdata runtime path.
  Saved nvdata filesystem metadata contains `WIFI` at 1026 bytes and `BT_Addr`
  at 66 bytes. No identifier bytes were printed during this audit.
- The donor Wi-Fi driver describes a 512-byte configuration structure with
  two 16-bit version fields before its MAC field. That does **not** establish
  the complete 1026-byte stock file format. Device ID's raw partition mapping,
  Bluetooth record layout and exact stock NVRAM version/checksum handling
  still require validation. Do not guess fixed offsets in whole partitions.

A first public flow can preserve raw identity backups while asking the owner
to save/confirm the three original Android values. Automatic field decoding
should be added only with versioned format evidence and comparisons against
original Android values. A missing value must remain explicitly unknown.

## Approved EMI without a per-unit preloader backup

The model-specific stock app firmware API returned version `2026020212` and
[its firmware archive](http://cdn.lifex360.com/attach/2026/03/c8znx1jxwhjr2kcv08t4.zip).
The metadata endpoint recovered from the app is
`http://gateway.dev.aiks360.com/api/v1/base-service/pub/checkAppVersionV2?_allow_anonymous=true`,
queried for `aiks_ha_remote_ha100.fw` without device identity.

| Input | Verified value |
|---|---|
| Complete ZIP | 518937104 bytes; SHA-256 `e9d6cd18a43c9195caac613a6168c43cf9b95758a7348931b17ae3aec0aa863a` |
| `preloader.img` member | 109992 bytes; SHA-256 `0ad0d14b7203d98a6567af7a022cfe5df5b6fcbba60cb4e9b4bc2ee569cf1069` |
| Extracted EMI | version 21; 752 bytes; SHA-256 `326b085f4a7917ea9e1f6271a8de86eb1a064097631750e3fc18e8d25577125d` |

The official member's EMI is byte-identical to the same-device preloader EMI
used in the validated private DA sessions. Extraction used the exact offline
`DAconfig.m_extract_emi` function at mtkclient revision
`60e07f3b343a4469389f15967626d63e049968d4`, from
`mtkclient/Library/DA/daconfig.py`. Its legacy DA consumer is
`mtkclient/Library/DA/legacy/dalegacy_lib.py`.

This offers a bootstrap path: the owner supplies/downloads the pinned official
ZIP, the host verifies it and extracts only approved EMI before DA upload.
There is no need to flash a preloader. Do not assume compatibility across HA100
memory/board revisions or enable upstream's heuristic preloader directory scan.
The separately hash-approved download agent and its source/authentication policy
remain required. Uploaded EMI equivalence still needs a controlled RAM-only
hardware check using the official member instead of the saved per-unit input.

The HTTP metadata field named `signature` is an MD5-style digest, not verified
publisher signing. The pinned SHA-256 detects changed bytes but does not itself
establish authenticated distribution. Keep the source-authentication and
redistribution reviews separate from successful extraction.

## Assemble vendor runtime locally from the official ZIP

All **33** files in the previously verified private runtime bundle match the
same official OTA exactly: 18 vendor files and 15 system files. This includes
WMT loaders, firmware/modules, the bionic linker/libraries and required linker
and SELinux property configuration. It is feasible to assemble these files on
the owner's machine instead of redistributing Couch's copy of them.

`tools/release/official_runtime.py` now implements the offline step:

```sh
# Run on Ollie/Linux with Python brotli and debugfs available.
python3 tools/release/official_runtime.py /path/to/official-fw.zip \
  /path/to/new-private-vendor-directory
```

`ha100_official_runtime.json` pins archive, selected ZIP members, reconstructed
system/vendor images and every runtime file. The tool never downloads, mounts,
opens a device, or performs general ZIP extraction. It accepts only bounded,
nonoverlapping full-OTA `new`/`zero`/`erase` transfer lists, verifies compressed
member hashes, bounds decompressed output to the declared ranges, and verifies
reconstructed image hashes before reading the allowlisted files with debugfs.
Temporary images are private and removed afterward. Final output is published
to the new directory only after all file hashes and inventory checks pass.

Output uses the existing private-vendor bundle format and works with
`prepare_private_rootfs.py`; `private_only` stays true, `installable` stays
false, and `redistribution_authorized` stays false. The real pinned ZIP produced
all 33 matching files on Ollie. Unit tests cover range overlap/bounds, forbidden
commands, stash rejection, ZIP member hashes/symlinks, truncation/expansion,
wrong archive hashes and existing-output refusal. Real Brotli tests run on
Ollie where that dependency is installed.

Download/bootstrap UX, independent model recognition, fresh-device identity
reporting, approved loader delivery, complete corresponding-source notices,
release authentication and actual fresh-Android end-to-end testing remain
separate work. None of these observations enable a public install gate.

## Owner-side input preparation and first capture

`tools/release/prepare_official_inputs.py` prepares the pinned official bootstrap
members and the existing runtime-file allowlist into a new private directory:

```sh
python3 tools/release/prepare_official_inputs.py official-fw.zip /private/owner-inputs
```

Only preloader (for EMI, never flashing), stock boot, odmdtbo and scatter are
selected from the archive. The existing 33-file vendor extractor runs alongside
them. The entire ZIP and each selected member are checked before publication.
There is no general archive extraction and no downloaded code is executed.
The receipt explicitly marks these as distribution inputs, **not originals
backed up from the owner's remote**. The OTA contains no original recovery;
that must be read from the actual device. `--bootstrap-only` skips runtime
extraction for an enrollment-only check.

`tools/installer/enroll_android.py` adds a read-only first-capture entry point.
It requires the owner to save the three Android identity values, an explicitly
authorized ADB serial and USB bus/port, the owner-side inputs, and a reviewed
mtkclient checkout/download-agent pin. It first binds canonical Android CID to
the selected physical USB device. After a manual restart into preloader, the
existing read-only adapter checks both GPT copies and fixed CID encoding.
Enrollment then requires official boot/odmdtbo prefixes and the official static
partition offsets before capturing calibration, boot, recovery and odmdtbo.
Every original is independently reread, and usable baseline publication waits
for USB cleanup. It exposes no partition writer and sends no reboot request.

The resulting baseline is labeled `first-stock-android-enrollment`, with
`prior_baseline: false` and opaque, undecoded identity preservation. It is not
misrepresented as an earlier trusted runtime baseline. Different stock builds,
changed partitions or inaccessible Android CID fail closed; arbitrary MT6580
hardware is not accepted merely because the chip family matches.

This is an enrollment prerequisite, not a public installation approval. The
normal-to-preloader port binding and official EMI upload still need a physical
fresh-device test. The public wizard must integrate this first capture before
any write path, and the host orchestration migration to Rust remains pending.
Windows driver/locking/deadline support, macOS filesystem dependency delivery,
public payload allowlist/corresponding-source review and per-platform execution
also remain release requirements. Neither a native TUI executable nor these
read-only fixtures satisfy them.

The native `tools/installer/host` workspace provides the same owner-side input
preparation without Python, debugfs or subprocesses. It reconstructs the pinned
filesystems with bounded Rust Brotli streams and reads the 33 allowlisted files
through a read-only Rust ext4 parser. See its [usage and platform validation](../tools/installer/host/README.md).
This moves input preparation into the native backend; USB/write orchestration
and stage-side personalization remain separate work.
