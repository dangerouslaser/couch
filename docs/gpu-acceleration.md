The panel work that hurts is full-screen image compositing: a crossfade between
two 480x800 backdrops costs **44-57ms per frame** on the CPU, in both LVGL and
Slint. Everything else fits comfortably in a 16ms budget. So this document is
about that one workload.

## What the hardware has

| piece | state |
|---|---|
| Mali-400 MP1 | present; kernel driver built in (`/dev/mali`, 854 symbols in kallsyms) |
| ION allocator | `/dev/ion` present |
| binder | `/dev/binder`, `/dev/hwbinder` present |
| DRM/KMS | **absent** - no `/dev/dri`, so Mesa/Lima is not an option |

[Lima](https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/lima.html) supports Mali-400, with its
kernel driver upstream since Linux 5.2. Kernel builds now work on Ollie, but
our 3.18 vendor tree lacks that DRM interface. Backporting Lima plus its
infrastructure is substantially larger than enabling a configuration option.
The working experiment uses the existing proprietary driver in a separate
bionic process; the musl Slint process still needs an integration bridge.

## What the stock firmware ships

From the device's own `vendor` (p14) and `system` (p21):

    /vendor/lib/hw/gralloc.mt6580.so        28,928
    /vendor/lib/hw/hwcomposer.mt6580.so    386,532
    /vendor/lib/hw/memtrack.mt6580.so       16,296
    /vendor/lib/egl/libGLES_mali.so      1,323,632
    /system/lib/egl/libGLES_android.so     108,452   (software fallback)

The dependency split is what decides the shape of any port. These are
`DT_NEEDED` entries read from the dynamic section (tools/elfdyn.py), not strings
scraped from the binaries - an earlier pass using `strings` reported
`libsec_mem.so` as a gralloc dependency, which the dynamic section shows it is
not.

    gralloc.mt6580.so     (12) liblog libcutils libion libhardware libion_mtk
                               libged libgralloc_extra libutils libc++ libc
                               libm libdl

    libGLES_mali.so       (13) libutils libcutils libhardware liblog libgpu_aux
                               libgralloc_extra libged libdpframework
                               libmtk_drvb libc++ libc libm libdl

    hwcomposer.mt6580.so  (28) the above plus libui libui_ext libsync libbwc
                               libbinder libpower libgui libm4u libhidlbase
                               libhwbinder libhidltransport libpq_prot
                               vendor.mediatek.hardware.pq@2.0_vendor
                               android.hardware.power@1.0
                               vendor.mediatek.hardware.power@1.1_vendor

Neither gralloc nor the GL driver needs binder, HIDL or libgui. hwcomposer needs
all three, plus two MediaTek vendor HIDL interfaces.

**Every one of those libraries is present on the device**, across `/system/lib`
and `/vendor/lib` - the closure is complete for both routes, with nothing
missing. Whatever else is hard about this, sourcing the blobs is not.

## Two possible routes

    Slint -> GLES2 -> libhybris -> gralloc + libGLES_mali -> kernel  (route A)
    Slint -> GLES2 -> libhybris -> gralloc + HWC + libGLES_mali      (route B)

**Route A (no HWC) is dead.** `tools/../src/fbprobe.c` answers it directly: the
module loads, identifies itself, and opens its allocator - but there is no
framebuffer device at all.

    ok   dlopen /mnt/v/lib/hw/gralloc.mt6580.so
    ok   HMI  id=gralloc name=Graphics Memory Allocator Module
    ok   gpu0 (allocator) rc=0 dev=0xb6ca9000
    FAIL fb (framebuffer device) rc=-22

-22 is EINVAL: this gralloc has no "fb" device to open. That matches Android 8,
which retired the framebuffer HAL in favour of hwcomposer. The `fb_post` string
in the binary is dead code.

Two things that probe did establish, both of them useful:

- **The allocator works.** gralloc can hand out graphics buffers, which is the
  half of the stack a GPU path actually needs.
- **libhybris is not required to run these blobs.** The probe is an ordinary
  bionic executable running natively under `/system/bin/linker` - this is an
  Android kernel, so they simply run. libhybris is only needed later to let a
  *musl* Rust binary link against them.

**Route A-prime** falls out of that, and is the interesting one: let the GPU
composite into a gralloc buffer and copy the result to `/dev/fb0` ourselves.
`libGLES_mali` advertises `EGL_ANDROID_image_native_buffer` and
`EGL_KHR_image_base`, so a gralloc buffer can be wrapped as an EGLImage and used
as an FBO render target - no window system, no hwcomposer, no binder. The final
copy costs 1.32ms at the 2.2 GB/s measured to the framebuffer, which is
affordable inside a 16ms budget when the compositing itself has become free.

**Route B (with HWC)** is the Halium/Ubuntu Touch shape and is known to work on
MediaTek parts, but it means bringing up binder, HIDL and enough of libgui for
`HWComposerNativeWindow`. Much larger surface area.

## Unknowns to resolve before committing

1. ~~Is `fb_post` functional?~~ **Answered: there is no fb device (EINVAL).**
   Route A is out; route A-prime or B.
2. Can EGL initialise with no window system, and can a gralloc buffer be bound
   as an FBO render target via `EGL_ANDROID_image_native_buffer`? This is the
   next probe, and it decides whether route A-prime works.
3. Does libhybris build against musl? It is normally built for glibc, Alpine does
   not package it, and it ships its own linker - so this is a real porting task,
   not a package install.
4. Slint's `FemtoVGRenderer` needs an EGL context supplied through a custom
   OpenGL context wrapper. Documented for embedded, but another integration.

## The cheaper alternative, first

NEON is unexploited and this is a Cortex-A7. LVGL ships NEON blenders, but
`lv_blend_neon.S` is written in GNU `as` macro syntax that LLVM's integrated
assembler rejects, and the NDK is LLVM-only. At roughly 130ns per composited
pixel we are plainly not using SIMD at all, so hand-porting those kernels (or
writing intrinsics) is a day of work against libhybris's weeks, and a 3-4x blend
speedup would bring the 50ms crossfade close to budget on its own.

Worth trying before committing to the Android graphics stack.

## Reproducing the shared-buffer probe

Build `src/eglprobe.c` with the Android ARMv7 NDK compiler (`-O3 -Wall -Wextra
-ldl`). Its `gralloc_abi.h` records the Android 8.1 32-bit ABI and asserts its
size. Run inside an isolated root with the original p21 mounted read-only at
`/system`, p14 read-only at `/vendor`, and `/dev`, `/proc`, `/sys` bind-mounted.
This avoids mixing the reduced Couch connectivity bundle with graphics blobs.
Do not replace the live system/vendor mounts. Unmount the probe root afterwards.

```
/probe /vendor/lib/egl/libGLES_mali.so --shared
/probe /vendor/lib/egl/libGLES_mali.so --shared --ion-sync
```

The probe allocates through gralloc, imports an
[EGL_ANDROID_image_native_buffer](https://registry.khronos.org/EGL/extensions/ANDROID/EGL_ANDROID_image_native_buffer.txt),
renders alternating colours, waits for GPU completion, locks for CPU reading,
and verifies every pixel across 30 frames. It never writes the display or
invents physical addresses. The handle contains a gralloc metadata fd and an
ION dma-buf fd; these are distinct. Any pixel mismatch returns failure.

Clear-only throughput is not a textured Slint benchmark. The original batched
clear timing can coalesce work and must not be reported as actual GUI frame
latency. Resolve cache ownership/completion correctness, then benchmark textured
compositing and presentation before integrating a GPU renderer. The existing
software renderer remains the production path.
