# Writing a Couch client

A *client* is a Rust crate in `clients/` that knows how to talk to one kind of
home device: Kodi's JSON-RPC, an LG TV's SSAP socket, a Denon receiver's
CR-delimited TCP protocol, a Home Assistant server, the remote's own IR
blaster. `clients/couch-sdk` is the contract those crates share, and
`clients/couch-echo` is a complete worked example you can copy.

Everything below can be built, run and tested on an ordinary Linux or macOS
machine. **You do not need an Astrion HA100 remote, a television, or any
credential to write a client and know that it is correct up to the wire
format.** What you cannot do without hardware is prove that a real device
behaves as you assumed; that boundary is spelled out at the end.

## What a client is, and what it is not

It **is** a crate the configuration daemon and the device GUI link directly.

It is **not** a plugin. There is no runtime loading, no stable ABI, no
`couch install <client>`, and no published package: `couch-sdk` is an in-tree
crate at version 0.1.0 that has never been released to crates.io. Adding a new
integration means seven manual edits across five workspaces, and they are
listed under [Registering a provider](#registering-a-provider). The
SDK makes the client itself correct, testable and consistent. It does not make
it discoverable, installable, or shippable by anyone but a maintainer building
an image.

## The architecture, in one screen

        clients/couch-control ── the broker: one owner per endpoint,
        a 16-deep queue, a 750 ms queue deadline, leases, and no retries.

                   ▲
                   └── clients/couch-sdk: the contract they share
```

Two rules the rest of this document follows from:

- **Credentials never enter `config.json`.** They live beside it in
  `connections/<connection-id>/<prefix>-connection.json`, mode 0600, and are
  absent from an exported house configuration. See `docs/connections.md`.
- **Nothing is retried.** A lost reply does not prove a lost command, and
  re-sending a power or input command that did arrive is worse than reporting
  the failure. The broker does not retry, and neither may your client.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Why | Checked with |
|---|---|---|
| Rust stable, `cargo` | everything here | `cargo --version` |
| `armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf` target | building for the remote | `rustup target add armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf` |
| `wasm32-unknown-unknown` + [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev) | only if you touch `web/` | `trunk --version` |

Validated against rustc 1.98.1. There is no `rust-toolchain.toml`, so any
recent stable should work; nothing here uses a nightly feature.

A pure-Rust client needs no cross C toolchain. `clients/.cargo/config.toml`
points the ARM target at `rust-lld`, which ships with the toolchain, so
`couch-sdk`, `couch-echo`, `couch-denon`, `couch-kodi` and `couch-ir` all
cross-compile with nothing else installed.

A client that pulls in TLS does need one, because `rustls` builds `ring`, and
`ring` is C and assembly. The repository's answer is `tools/arm-musl-cc.py`,
a wrapper around Zig, selected with the environment variable
`CC_armv7_unknown_linux_musleabihf`; `tools/build-webui.sh` sets it up on
macOS, and `docs/home-assistant.md` shows it by hand. Without it, the
whole-workspace ARM build stops at
`failed to find tool "arm-linux-musleabihf-gcc"`. This is the single strongest
reason to think twice before adding a dependency.

## Quickstart

From the repository root. Each of these was run exactly as written:

```sh
cd clients
cargo test -p couch-sdk --features testing     # the SDK's own tests
cargo test -p couch-echo                       # the example client's contract tests
cargo run -p couch-echo --example demo         # a whole session against a fake TV
cargo test -p couch-denon                      # a real client, through the SDK
cargo doc -p couch-sdk --features testing --no-deps   # rustdoc, harness included
```

`cargo run -p couch-echo --example demo` prints a success, a refusal by the
device, three refusals by the client, and a timeout, then lists every request the
fake television actually received:

```
volume-up          -> Ok(())
status             -> Ok(Status { on: Some(true), muted: Some(false), volume: Some(31), ... })
inputs             -> Ok([Selectable { id: "hdmi1", name: "Blu-ray" }, ...])
power-off          -> Err(Remote("the TV is locked"))
fast-forward       -> Err(Unsupported)
not-a-function     -> Err(Unsupported)
input:../escape    -> Err(Unsupported)
home (no reply)    -> Err(Timeout)
```

## Implementing a client

Copy `clients/couch-echo` to `clients/couch-<yours>`, add it to the `members`
list in `clients/Cargo.toml`, and rename the types. Then:

### 1. Settings

One serde struct holding what you need to reach one device, implementing
`ClientSettings`:

```rust
impl ClientSettings for Settings {
    const FILE_PREFIX: &'static str = "echo";   // -> echo-connection.json
    fn validate(&self) -> Result<()> { /* reject what cannot address a device */ }
}
```

`validate` runs before every save and after every load, so a file edited by
hand into an unusable state never reaches a socket. The provided `load`/`save`
write the file atomically at mode 0600 and fsync both the file and its
directory. Temporary names are unique across concurrent saves and stale files,
and the temporary file is removed whichever step fails. Do not
reimplement this: losing power mid-write is how a pairing key becomes
indistinguishable from a revoked one.

The underlying `load_private`/`save_private` are typed `std::io::Result`, not
`couch_sdk::Result`. An existing client that already distinguishes "the file is
not there" from "the file is not usable" keeps that distinction by calling them
directly - `couch-denon` does, and a test pins it. The trait's `load`/`save`
are the opinionated wrapper: unreadable and unparseable are both
`Error::Invalid`, because to someone setting up a connection they mean the same
thing.

`ClientSettings::path_in` returns `Result<PathBuf>`: connection IDs are one
directory component, never a path fragment. An empty ID remains the legacy
singleton layout; nonempty IDs containing `/`, `.` or `..` are rejected.

Reject anything that could break your wire format here - a hostname containing
whitespace, a token containing a control character - rather than at the point
of use.

### 2. Capabilities

Declare exactly the functions you implement, using
`couch_model::commands::Function` IDs:

```rust
fn capabilities() -> &'static [Capability] {
    &[("power-on", "Main zone on"), ("volume-up", "Volume up (0.5 dB)"), ...]
}
```

The IDs are the ones persisted in `config.json` and parsed by the GUI; the
labels are what the button-mapping picker shows. Declaring something you have
not implemented puts a key on screen that silently does nothing, so the test
harness checks every ID parses, is canonical, is unique, and is accepted by
your own `supports`.

Dynamic functions - `input:<id>` and `app:<id>` - are **not** listed here.
Declare them by overriding `supports_input` / `supports_app`, which are asked
about one specific ID. Constrain those IDs: they are persisted and read back by
other processes.

### 3. Commands, state and errors

`command(&str)` is the boundary where a stored string becomes an action. It
parses, checks the capability gate, and only then calls your `execute`. Unknown
text and undeclared functions are refused **before any I/O**, which is worth a
test of its own: a stale button mapping must not be able to make a device do
something arbitrary, and must not cost a round trip to find out.

`status()` returns what the device *said*. Every field of `Status` is optional
because "does not report its volume" and "is at volume zero" are different
answers. Leave a field `None` rather than inferring it from the last command
you sent. `couch-denon` leaves `volume` empty on purpose: the receiver reports
decibels, and a percentage would be an invention.

Errors are seven variants, chosen to match what the broker already reports:

| Variant | Means | Shown as |
|---|---|---|
| `Protocol` | it answered, and the answer did not parse or did not confirm | "response this client could not use" |
| `Transport` | unreachable, or the connection dropped | "could not be reached" |
| `Timeout` | no reply before the deadline. **Not** proof the command failed | "did not reply before the deadline" |
| `Rejected` | understood and refused | "refused the request" |
| `Unsupported` | never declared; raised before any I/O | "does not support that function" |
| `Invalid` | the settings cannot address a device | "settings are incomplete" |
| `Remote(String)` | anything with a message worth showing | the message, verbatim |

Put the device's own explanation in `Remote` when it gives one: "the TV is
locked" is useful to the person holding the remote, and `Protocol` is not.
Never put a credential in one - these strings reach the browser and the panel.

`Error::retryable()` is true only for `Transport`. `Timeout` is deliberately
not retryable.

### 4. Tests, with no device

`couch_sdk::testing` (feature `testing`, enable it in `[dev-dependencies]`)
gives you a scripted TCP peer and a conformance check:

```rust
let host = MockHost::start(
    Script::new().terminator(b'\n')
        .on("CMD volume-up", Reply::line("OK"))
        .on("CMD power-off", Reply::line("ERR the TV is locked"))
        .on("CMD home", Reply::Silence)      // the client must time out
        .on("CMD ok", Reply::Close)          // and survive a hang-up
);
// The second argument is the actual host that observes every refusal the
// harness tries, so a client cannot claim to be silent with a made-up counter.
assert_contract::<EchoTv>(&settings(&host), &host);
```

`Reply::Silence` and `Reply::Close` are there because those are the two failure
paths clients get wrong. `host.requests()` is the assertion that matters most
often: it proves what your client did *not* send.

`contract_findings::<C>()` returns every problem at once rather than failing on
the first, and `assert_contract::<C>()` is the same check as an assertion.
Checking the returned error is not enough on its own - a client that pings the
device and *then* refuses returns exactly the right error and is still wrong -
so both inspect the mock host's request log and fail the client if a refusal
appears in it.
It also round-trips your settings through a real file to confirm they survive
being written at 0600 and read back.

None of this reaches a shipped binary. The harness is behind an off-by-default
feature and belongs in `[dev-dependencies]`, so a production build links no
listener and spawns no thread:

```sh
cargo tree -p <your-crate> -e normal -f "{p} {f}" | grep couch-sdk   # "default"
cargo tree -p <your-crate> -e dev    -f "{p} {f}" | grep couch-sdk   # "default,testing"
strings target/release/libcouch_sdk.rlib | grep -c MockHost          # 0
```

## Registering a provider

The SDK does not wire your client into the product. Until you make these edits,
your crate compiles and its tests pass, and nothing else in the repository can
reach it. Five subsystems have to learn about a new provider - the model, the
control broker, the daemon, the device GUI and the web UI - which is seven
concrete edits spread across the five Rust workspaces `AGENTS.md` lists
(`model/`, `clients/`, `daemon/`, `ui/`, `web/`): `couch_sdk::catalog_differences::<YourClient>(&integration)` reports
the state of step 3 and is worth a test either way - `couch-echo` asserts that
it is *unregistered*, and `couch-denon` asserts that it matches exactly.

1. **`model/couch-model/src/connection.rs`** - add a `Provider` variant plus its
   `kind()` slug and `label()`, and a `resolve_integration` arm.
2. **`model/couch-model/src/device.rs`** - add the matching `Integration`
   variant and its `via()` string. This is the discriminator in saved
   configurations, so pick it once.
3. **`model/couch-model/src/buttons.rs`** - add the `functions()` arm. It must
   equal your `capabilities()`, in the same order, including labels. If you
   support `input:`/`app:`, also extend `commands.rs`'s `Function::supports`.
   Add a rule in `validate.rs` if your provider has one (there may only be one
   IR blaster, for instance).
4. **`clients/couch-control`** - a `Spec` variant, the `Op` variants for your
   operations, a `Client` enum arm, a `From<your::Error>` impl, and a proxy
   struct in `proxies.rs`. This is what gives you a single owner per endpoint,
   leases, and the queue. Do not open your own long-lived socket from the GUI.
5. **`daemon/couch-confd/src/api/<kind>.rs`** - the REST surface, plus `mod` in
   `api.rs` and an arm in `api/connections.rs` mapping
   `/api/connections/<id>/<kind>/...` to it and naming your credential file.
6. **`ui/couch-gui/src/activity_buttons.rs`** - an arm in `execute_with_input`,
   and a helper in `connections.rs` if you load credentials there.
7. **`web/couch-web/src/screens/`** - a setup screen, plus the two matches in
   `screens/connections.rs` that offer and render your provider.

Then update `docs/connections.md`, which is the document a user reads.

Do not skip step 4 by talking to the network from the GUI: two consumers, a
browser and the panel, reach the same device, and the broker is what stops them
opening two sockets and interleaving a mute read with someone else's write.

## What the broker guarantees, and what it expects

From `docs/control-service.md` and `clients/couch-control/src/lib.rs`:

- One worker per endpoint, so a slow receiver cannot block a different device.
- A 16-deep queue per endpoint; a full queue is an error, not a wait.
- Work that has sat in the queue for 750 ms is dropped rather than sent late.
- Each consumer holds a lease; the transport closes when the last one is
  released, and unused leases expire after 30 seconds, including those lost to
  a crashed process.
- Changing a connection's credentials discards the old transport.

What it expects from you in return: **one instance owns one device's transport,
does no internal queuing, and is never shared between threads.**

## Building for the remote

```sh
cd clients
cargo build -p couch-echo --release --target armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf
file target/armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf/release/libcouch_echo.rlib
```

A cross-built binary should come out static and stripped - `couch-denon` is an
`ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, EABI5, statically linked, stripped` of about
380 KB.

Notes that will save you a day:

- The workspace release profile is `opt-level = "s"`, LTO, one codegen unit,
  `panic = "abort"`, stripped. Binaries land in
  `clients/target/armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf/release/`.
- `panic = "abort"` means `catch_unwind` is not available to you.
- The linker is `rust-lld`, set in `clients/.cargo/config.toml`, because Apple's
  `ld` rejects the flags rustc passes for this target. No cross-gcc, no Docker.
- **Any dependency that binds a C library costs you a cross toolchain.** That
  is why `couch-voice` implements ALSA ioctls against `libc` rather than using
  an ALSA crate, why `couch-ir` writes the MediaTek PWM ABI directly, and why
  the daemon uses `tiny_http` rather than an async stack. The one place the
  repository pays the price anyway is TLS: `ring` needs an ARM musl C compiler,
  supplied through `CC_armv7_unknown_linux_musleabihf` as described above.
  Before adding a dependency, check what it links.
- Cross-compiling proves it builds and links. It does not prove it runs: the
  remote is a quad-A7 with an Alpine userland and a flash-backed rootfs.

## Limits, honestly

- **No runtime loading, no ABI, no distribution.** Covered above, and worth
  repeating because every "SDK" implies otherwise.
- **The SDK is 0.1.0 and in-tree.** It has no stability guarantee and no
  release. Expect to change with it.
- **One existing client has been adapted.** `couch-denon` uses the shared
  settings helper and implements `DeviceClient`. The other nine keep their own
  shapes; there is no migration in progress and none is required.
- **No streaming or subscription API.** `couch-webos` and `couch-kodi` receive
  pushed updates, and those paths stay in the client and the broker. The SDK
  covers request/response, status and enumeration only.
- **No async.** Everything is blocking with explicit deadlines, matching the
  rest of the repository.
- **Discovery is the daemon's.** The SDK's `Discover` trait carries a service
  name and a translation from a found address to settings - the same fact
  `couch-androidtv` and `couch-appletv` already publish as `MDNS_SERVICE`, and
  `couch-echo` implements it - but the mDNS browser stays in
  `daemon/couch-confd/src/api/streaming_tv.rs`, so one process rather than five
  holds a multicast socket. Nothing calls `Discover` yet.
- **The mock host is a line protocol.** It fits Denon, Kodi over TCP and the
  example; it is not an HTTP server, a TLS endpoint or a WebSocket peer. A
  client needing those still writes its own fixture, as `couch-ha` and
  `couch-hue` do with `tiny_http`.
- **`cargo fmt --check` is not clean on committed code** in any of the five
  workspaces, including `clients/`. Check your own crate with
  `cargo fmt -p <crate> -- --check` and leave the rest alone unless you are
  fixing it deliberately.

## Validation of this SDK

Recorded so the next person knows what was actually run, on 11 September 2026,
with rustc 1.98.1 on both machines.

Host tests, all passing, on the Linux build host and on macOS:

| Workspace | Result |
|---|---|
| `clients/` (`cargo test --workspace`) | 179 passed, 0 failed |
| `model/` | 41 passed, 0 failed |
| `daemon/` | 44 passed, 0 failed |
| `ui/` | 109 passed, 0 failed |

The `couch-denon` adaptation is covered by its own regression tests: the
on-disk JSON schema and filename, mode 0600, a rejected save leaving the
previous file byte for byte, a write that fails after the temporary file exists
cleaning up after itself, the absent-versus-corrupt error split, and the
settings validation table. Its transport tests are unchanged.

One behaviour there is deliberately *not* preserved. Before this change, a
failed read or write of the settings file produced `couch_denon::Error::Io`,
whose message is "Cannot reach the AVR. Check its address and Network Control
setting." - so a full or read-only flash sent the user to their receiver's
network settings. Those two paths now return a separate `Error::Storage` with
a storage-specific, credential-safe message. Every network path still returns
`Io` with its original message, and nothing outside the crate reads or writes
that file.

Also run: `cargo fmt -p couch-sdk -p couch-echo -p couch-denon -- --check`
clean on both machines; `cargo doc -p couch-sdk --no-deps` with and without
`--features testing`, 0 warnings; and `cargo run -p couch-echo --example demo`,
which printed the acceptance, refusal, gate and timeout lines shown earlier.

Cross-compilation for `armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf`:

- `couch-sdk`, `couch-echo` and `couch-denon` build on the Linux host with no
  cross C toolchain at all. `couch-denon` comes out a statically linked,
  stripped ARM ELF of 385 KB.
- The **whole** `clients/` workspace needs `ring`'s C compiler. It built on
  macOS with `CC_armv7_unknown_linux_musleabihf=tools/arm-musl-cc.py` and Zig,
  and it does **not** build on the Linux host as that host is currently set up,
  because it has neither a musl cross gcc nor Zig. That is a property of the
  host, not of this change.

Not validated, and not validatable without hardware: anything on the remote
itself. No device, USB, serial or flashing operation was involved in any of the
above.

## Hardware validation boundary

Passing tests mean your protocol handling, capability gating, error mapping and
settings persistence are right. They say nothing about whether a real device
accepts your commands, whether the remote's panel renders your provider, or
whether anything behaves under the device's memory and flash constraints.

Device validation is separate, is recorded separately, and needs the hardware:
see `AGENTS.md` and the validation notes in `docs/`. IR transmission in
particular is still unavailable on the current kernel (`docs/connections.md`).
Never write the `preloader_*` or `lk` partitions. Keep credentials, partition
backups and per-device calibration out of Git.
