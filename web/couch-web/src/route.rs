//! Where in the app we are, kept in the browser's URL.
//!
//! Hand-rolled rather than `leptos_router`. The small route set is explicit and the
//! whole router is one enum, two string functions and a `popstate` listener;
//! the crate would add a matcher, a nested-route tree and a set of macros to
//! do the same thing, on a bundle that is downloaded over the remote's own
//! WiFi.
//!
//! It is a real URL rather than app-internal state because the thing this runs
//! on is a phone, and on a phone Back means "up one level". Without history
//! entries, Back leaves the app entirely from the first screen a user drills
//! into.
