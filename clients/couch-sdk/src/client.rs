//! The contract: what a client declares, and what it is asked to do.
//!
//! A Couch integration is not a plugin. Nothing loads it at runtime; it is a
//! crate in the `clients/` workspace that the daemon and the GUI link, and
//! adding one still means seven manual edits across four workspaces (see
//! `docs/client-sdk.md`).
//! What this trait fixes is the part that was previously re-decided per client:
//! the vocabulary of commands, the point at which an unsupported command is
//! refused, and the shape of the answer.
//!
//! The vocabulary is [`couch_model::commands::Function`], because that is what
//! the configuration file persists, what the button-mapping UI offers and what
//! the GUI's executor parses. A client never sees free text except at
//! [`DeviceClient::command`], which is the boundary.
