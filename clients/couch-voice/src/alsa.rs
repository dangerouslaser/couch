//! Capture, straight onto the ALSA character devices.
//!
//! The flow is the one every ALSA client uses and alsa-lib merely wraps:
//! open `/dev/snd/pcmC<card>D<device>c`, negotiate `hw_params`, set
//! `sw_params`, PREPARE, START, then `readi` in a loop. Doing it by hand costs
//! about four hundred lines; linking libasound costs a cross sysroot, which
//! this project has already decided it will not have.
//!
//! Two departures from what alsa-lib would do, both because this code has to
//! run on hardware nobody has proven yet.
//!
//! The device is opened non-blocking and every read is fronted by `poll` with
//! a deadline. A capture device whose DMA never starts - a plausible outcome
//! if the analogue path is powered down - blocks forever in a blocking
//! `readi`, and a probe that hangs tells you nothing. With a deadline it says
//! "this device produced no frames in two seconds", which is an answer.
//!
//! And there is no `snd_pcm_status`: its struct grew a member after 3.18, so
//! its ioctl number is not the same on every kernel. Overruns are detected the
//! way they are reported anyway, by `readi` returning EPIPE.
