//! Waiting for a key on the remote's own keypad.
//!
//! This exists so a recording can be bracketed by the thing a person is
//! actually holding. Asking someone to speak into a microphone during a window
//! that started when a shell command ran, seconds before they could read that
//! it had, is how you collect recordings of somebody about to talk.
//!
//! Push-to-talk is the shape the finished product wants too - hold a key, say
//! the thing, let go - so this is the primitive rather than a test fixture.
//!
//! Both keypad nodes are read: on this device a given key arrives on one of
//! `mt_gpio_kpd` or `mtk-kpd` and which one is not obvious. `couch-gui` reads
//! them at the same time, which is fine - every reader of an evdev node gets
//! its own copy of the stream.
