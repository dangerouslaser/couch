//! Bluetooth on and off.
//!
//! Turning Bluetooth on brings up the whole stack inside the Alpine root, where
//! dbus/bluetoothd live: couch-bt-bridge (opening the MediaTek transport is what
//! powers the radio and creates hci0), then dbus, bluetoothd, and couch-bt-hid
//! (the HID GATT app + raw-HCI advertising). Everything runs under one
//! `chroot /mnt/alpine` so they share the same dbus. The orchestration is here,
//! in Rust, rather than a shipped shell script: a new script in the runtime
//! bundle would be refused by updaters older than this one, whereas the new
//! couch-bt-hid binary is accepted (a couch-* executable). Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
//! share one radio, so the stack starts only on the user's toggle.
//!
//! Bring-up takes a few seconds, so the service publishes its progress in a
//! state file (`starting`, `on`, `off`, or `error <sentence>`) that the GUI,
//! the web UI and the API read while they wait, instead of showing "off" until
//! the last piece is up.
