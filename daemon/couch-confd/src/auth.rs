//! Pairing by a PIN shown on the remote's own screen.
//!
//! The credential is physical access to the remote, which is the same boundary
//! the SSH enrolment button already draws: if you can read the screen, you are
//! standing in the house. Nothing is stored, nothing is enrolled ahead of time,
//! and there is no password for anyone to forget or write down.
//!
//! Four digits is only ten thousand guesses, so the digits alone are not the
//! defence - the defence is that a guess costs an attempt against a challenge
//! that expires, and burning through the attempts is visible. A PIN lives two
//! minutes, dies after five wrong answers, and every new challenge lights up
//! the remote. An attacker on the LAN who wants to brute force this has to make
//! the remote in your living room flash a fresh PIN a thousand times.
//!
//! That visibility is the quiet second feature: a PIN appearing when nobody
//! opened the page means somebody else on the network just tried.
//!
//! Expiry is enforced by a reaper rather than only noticed on the next request.
//! The lazy version left `/tmp/couch.pin` on disk whenever nobody followed up -
//! which is exactly the case where a PIN is showing that nobody asked for - and
//! the panel sat on it. The file also carries its own deadline, so a `couch-gui`
//! that restarts does not hand a stale PIN a fresh two minutes.
//!
//! Sessions live in memory only. Restarting the daemon logs everyone out, which
//! is the right way round - a config daemon that survives a reboot holding open
//! sessions is one that cannot be reset by turning it off and on again.
