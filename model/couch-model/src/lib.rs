//! The home configuration a Couch remote is pointed at.
//!
//! One definition, three consumers: `couch-confd` reads and writes it on the
//! device, `couch-web` edits it in a browser, and `couch-gui` will eventually
//! render it. Sharing the crate is the whole point - a field renamed here is a
//! compile error on both sides rather than a JSON key that silently stops
//! matching.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Rooms, scenes and activities are flat lists with stable ids; an [`Area`]
//! holds *references* to all three rather than owning them. That is not
//! decoration. The GUI's seed data has "Bedroom" in both WHOLE HOME and

//! UPSTAIRS, and "Movie night" in both WHOLE HOME and DOWNSTAIRS: a room is a
//! place with devices in it, and an area is a named view over a set of places.
//! Nesting them would mean editing the same room's device list twice and
//! watching the two copies drift.
//!
//! # Configuration, not state
//!
//! Nothing here says whether a light is on. The GUI's `RoomRow` carries
//! `active-count`, `idle` and `offline`, and its `LiveActivity` is whatever is
//! playing right now; all of that is runtime state a hub daemon will supply,
//! and none of it belongs in a file a human edits. What this crate does carry
//! is the *configured* [`Activity`] - "Watch TV in the living room", a name, a
//! room and the devices it brings up. A live activity is one of these that is
//! currently running, and the strip an area draws is the subset of them that
//! area lists (see [`Config::activities_in_area`]).
//!
//! An area lists its activities rather than deriving them from its rooms,
//! because which of them are worth a strip is a judgement the derivation gets
//! wrong: the GUI's WHOLE HOME shows three where its rooms host five, and
//! DOWNSTAIRS shows five in three rooms. Both readings cannot follow from room
//! membership, so the list is configuration - the same call an area already
//! makes about scenes.
//!
//! Likewise the GUI's `devices: "5 devices"` and `detail: "Kodi, Hue, LG C3"`
//! are rendered strings. They are stored here as the device list they were
//! rendered from, and reproduced by [`Room::device_summary`] and
//! [`Room::device_detail`].
